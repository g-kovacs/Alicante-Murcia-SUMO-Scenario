# Modelling Notes

## Direction Signs

There is a special type of combined acceleration/deceleration lane where the direction signs play an important role in the traffic behavior. It is the case where the rightmost lane of the mainline becomes a combined acceleration/deceleration lane separated from the other mainline lanes by a solid line. Direction signs on the area indicate that through traffic shall not use this lane, only traffic with intention to take one of the off-ramps can use this lane. In order to model this case in SUMO, both the solid line and the direction sign shall be modelled. The solid line is directly modeled by NETCONVERT during the importing process. Separated lanes are modelled as independent edges, so vehicles cannot change between that lanes. For the direction sign modelling, an **innovative technique using rerouters** has been proposed in this work. A closing rerouter have been placed just before the start of the combined lane indicating that the lane is closed, so the vehicles shall not use this lane unless their route requires to use this lane to be completed. With this approach, the vehicles whose route use the combined lane, that is the ones that are taking an off-ramp, will ignore the lane closing, whereas the rest of the vehicles whose route not necessarily has to use that lane, will see the lane as closed and will use the leftmost lanes of the mainline to continue their routes.
